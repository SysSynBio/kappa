#On the actual simulator

1/Perform computation on the not-yet expanded solution 
2/Reduce memory usage by using rule reference in the flow relation
3/Do a 64bits specific code
4/Make a more efficient pushout function

#New simulator
Write a species-based simulator

#Interactive mode
Write an interactive mode for checking rule syntax and answering the factory without having to pay the price of spawning a process each time.
